It's good practice to commit your code after each green test. Make sure you add a brief, but informative commit message.

**Tips**

- Write the **simplest** code needed to make the test pass. 
- Refactor: 
    - Are any methods more than 5 or 10 lines of code?
    - Is it obvious what each section of code does? If not, how could you make it obvious?
- Commits should have informative messages
