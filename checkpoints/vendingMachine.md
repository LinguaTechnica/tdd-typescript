### User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

Below are a list of simple stories. Collaborate with your group to implement them as best you can. **Money is valued in Rupees (Rs)! NOT dollars ($)**

1 As a customer, I want to see that the vending machine has items, so that I can purchase them.
- when view the machine,
- then I see items inside which I can buy, along with their price.

2 As a customer, I want to know how much money I have deposited, so that I know what I can purchase.
- Given a vending machine with items, 
- when I insert money, 
- then I see a message with the total I have deposited.

3 As a customer, I want to add additional money, so that I can increase my purchase power.
- Given I have deposited money in the vending machine,
- when I deposit additional money,
- then I see the new total on a screen. 

4 As a customer, I want to see a message if my item is unavailable, so that I can make another choice.
- Given I have selected an item, 
- when it's unavailable, 
- then I see a message that the item is unavailable.

5 As a customer, I want to see a message if my deposit is insufficient, so that I know to add more money.

- then I see a message telling me how much more to deposit.

6 As a customer, I want to receive change, so that I donâ€™t pay more than the item costs.

- when the item costs <price> 
- then I receive <change> (in correct monetary units)

Examples:
