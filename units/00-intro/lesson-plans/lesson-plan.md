# Lesson Plan

This unit covers a lot of shallow ground by introducing Typescript within an XP framework. 
This first week has a lot of shallow ground to cover, starting with XP and key practices. Please review the [unit plan on the shared drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUDnKEH063gkWQMWIiXrJU7oKQRwftckSHRdr6y05l4/edit).

## Overview

The goal is to ensure learners can write basic typescript to use it for developing Angular applications. 

**XP Goals**
- Test Cycle
- Collaboration with pair programming
- Unit tests and fakes (basics)

**Typescript Goals**
- Static types and syntax 
- Modules and imports/exports
- Classes and accessors

**Tools**
- Getting VS Code setup 
- Using the debugger
- Browser tools 

## XP and Typescript Fundamentals 

A good part of this week will focus on getting learners comfortable with: 

* Typescript 
* XP: pair programming and tdd 
* Dev Tools: browser and VS Code/Webstorm

The exercises laid out for this week wiill combine with one of the above topics each day to set a strong foundation for their expected workflow the following week. Habits established here set instructor expectations of how learners should perform throughout the course. 

## Exercises

Below are some recommended exercises to achieve this weeks goals. All of them rely on pair programming, where pairs are shuffled at least weekly.

* Data Structures: Good intro to pair programming, but short. Fix failing tests. 
* Shopping Cart: Intro to the test cycle.
* Vending Machine: Practice test cycle more.
* Bowling Kata: Provide tests and the challenge is to implement the code.
* Mortgage Lender: Very good as an assessment of basic TDD.
* JS TDD Katas: to fill out the time for exercises that are shorter than expected.

Stretch goals should be added to each unit along with reading and A/V materials for independent study.

### Data Structures

Tests are provided and learners must implement the code to make them pass. The primary goal is to practice pair programming by setting them in context and encouraging collaboration. 

### Shoppping Cart 

Good ole shopping cart! This is the first opportunity to write their own tests and learn a strong workflow for the test cycle.

### Vending Machine

Offers a challenge slightly above Shopping Cart, but not by much. Can be used as a follow-up for more practice. 

### Bowling Kata

Tests are provided, but there's no code! Their challenge is to implement the app without changing the tests. Learners should start to understand and appreciate the 'Refactor' step of the test cycle.
