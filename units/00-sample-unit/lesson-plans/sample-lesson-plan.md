# Lesson Name

Lessons plans can take a variety of shapes. As you discover lesson strucutres with good outcomes, please codify it into the curriculum by adding a lesson plan for it into this directory!

Any client-specific lesson plans should be named using `(clientName)-lesson-plan.md`. Other lesson plans should be named appropriately and have a breif overview of the lesson plan at the top.
