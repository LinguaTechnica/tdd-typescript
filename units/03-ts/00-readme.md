## Exercises

Below are some recommended exercises to achieve this weeks goals. All of them rely on pair programming, where pairs are shuffled at least weekly.

### Data Structures

Tests are provided and learners must implement the code to make them pass. The primary goal is to practice pair programming by setting them in context and encouragin collaboration. As both are learning TDD, pair programming is a tool to help them learn it faster.

### Shoppping Cart 

Good ole shopping cart! This is the first opportunity to write their own tests. 

### Vending Machine

Offers a challenge slightly above Shopping Cart, but not by much. Can be used as a follow-up for more practice. 

### Bowling Kata

This can be done in 2 ways: tests provided as an additional collaboration challenge or as an exercise directly after a TDD lesson where the goals can be emphasized.
