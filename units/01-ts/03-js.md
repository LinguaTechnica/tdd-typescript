# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript (JS), commonly known as the language of the web, is most often used in reference to a specific standard - ECMA 262, or EcmaScript.  Given the widespread use of the language for web development, the environment has exploded in the last decade and it is now common to find backend applications built using Node, mobile applications that use React Native, and desktop applications built on Electron.  For this pre-work, we will entirely focus on JS as a frontend technology.

For a full overview, please read through the [Javascript overview][mdn-js-what-is-js].

## Documentation

The [EcmaScript standard][ecmascript-standard] is held by ECMA International and updated yearly by [TC39][tc39-site] (technical committee 39). These yearly updates started in 2015 with ES6 (sometimes referred to as ES2015).

[Mozilla Developer Network][mdn-js-reference] maintains full documentation in addition to a [learning path][mdn-js-learning-path] that contains tutorials.  You can also find a full reference on [W3 Schools][w3s-js-reference], which also contains a full [JS tutorial][w3s-js-tutorial].

## Learning Resources

Below are a number of learning resources.  Feel free to use any of them that you please, but please get used to using official and semi-official documentation for your reference points.  If you are brand new to the topic, the below resources are in sequential order.
