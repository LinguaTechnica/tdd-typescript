# Web Applications

Build a simple Vending Machine app! Customers can insert money, buy snacks and receive change. Here's an example of how it wil work from the customers point of view:

All images and item data are provided for you, and your application is configured. Your task is to use TDD to develop the Vending Machine application. 

## What's an App?

There are generally 2 parts to a web application:

- Backend: the application itself
- Frontend: the UI 

## How do they work?

Front and back are integrated using scripts. 

Generally, developing UIs is a very difficult job because it involves assessing user needs and behavior, as well as creating functional interfaces. It's a lot more than simply writing some scripts and running them. 

This makes them a bit more difficult to understand and less transparent compared to developing web applications. 

Web applications are a bit more straight forward than UIs. However, each has it's challenges and neither is immune to complexity. That's where you come in. 

By writing tests first, you're taking the first step towards minimizing complexity in your applications.
