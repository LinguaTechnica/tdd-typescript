# User Interfaces

You should have completed Part 1 before moving on to this section.

## The User Interface

So far, you've created the application portion of the Vending Machine; it works, but only a developer could actually test it out. The next step is begin defining a UI so that users can eventualy use it to interact with the app. 

For this portion of the lesson, focus strictly on the HTML and CSS. **There's no JS or Typescript involved.**

### Design 

Since you're intimately familiar with how the machine works, you can imagine what it might look like to use your app. For example, using the current stories and acceptance criteria we know that the user:

- Can view the vending machine contents. 
- Can view prices, names and items.
- Can insert money and receive change. 

This is why stories need to describe _features_, not technical implementation details. The same stories are sufficient to get us started with designing UI. Of course, this varies by project scope: sometimes you need new, additional stories and criteria, but sometimes you don't.

### Features 

Below is a simple summary of the features you'll need to ensure you're machine has. Implementation is up to you.

* Insert money 
* View how much money is deposited 
* View how much change is owed
* View items, including the name and price. 
* View messages from the machine (such as when more money needs to be deposited, and so forth).
