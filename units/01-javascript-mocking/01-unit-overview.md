# Topic Overview

## Learning Objectives

In this unit you will:

- Identify pure and impure functions
- Write tests using jest mocks
- Inject test mocks using constructor injection
 
You'll know you're ready to move on when you can complete this lesson's [checkpoint](../../checkpoints/javascript-mocking-checkpoint.md).

### !instructor

<!-- Note:  Remove this instructor tag if you are past phase one of a migration/creation -->

## Topic Content

This section should contain a high level overview of all of the content that students will encounter in a lecture, which serves as a reference point for them - any subsequent files should be a walkthrough of a project that will serve as a supplemental resource, still following an "I do, we do, you do" structure.

### !end-instructor

## Check for Understanding

A check for understanding should happen at the end of this reading so that students have a chance to reflect on the content they have seen - this is not a replacement for a checkpoint.
